A package for the R language, provided graph derived metadata analytics functionality.

This package provides a suit of functions, built from the igraph library, that normalises hypergraph lists into normalised edge lists, constructs an R graph object, rebuilds multiple graphs into exploded grain matrices and conducts a series of matrice delta calculations.

More details in the MAN files, and example included.

Build in collaboration with Andy Morgan (https://github.com/minkymorgan).
